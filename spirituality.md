# A Guide to Spirituality Without Religion
## Why spirituality

I’m not denying the importance of achieving  one’s goals, maintaining one’s health, or keeping
one’s children clothed  and fed — but most  of us spend our time seeking  happiness and security
without acknowledging the underlying purpose of our search. Each of us is looking for a path back to
the present: We are trying to find good enough reasons to be satisfied now.

Acknowledging  that  this is  the  structure  of the  game  we  are playing  allows  us  to play  it
differently. How  we pay attention  to the  present moment largely  determines the character  of our
experience and, therefore, the quality of our lives.


It would not be too strong to say that I felt sane for the first time in my life. And yet the change
in my consciousness seemed entirely straightforward. I  was simply talking to my friend and realized
that I had ceased  to be concerned about myself. I was no  longer anxious, self-critical, guarded by
irony, in competition, avoiding  embarrassment, ruminating about the past and  future, or making any
other gesture of thought or attention that separated me from him. I was no longer watching myself.


In  this book,  “spirituality“  is a  term  used to  discuss the  efforts  people make,  through
meditation, psychedelics, or other  means, to fully bring their minds into the  present or to induce
nonordinary states of consciousness.

There is more to understanding the human condition than science and secular culture generally admit,
hence the need for spirituality.


When trying to build a bridge between science and spirituality, there are 2 common pitfalls in which
people fall:

        1. pseudo-spirituality:

           a spiritual experience is just a grandiose way of describing an ordinary state of mind.

           This is false: parental love, artistic inspiration, awe at the beauty of the night sky …
                          are NOT spiritual experiences.

        2. pseudo-science:

           New Age thinkers idealize altered states of consciousness and draw specious connections
           between subjective experience and the spookier theories at the frontier of physics.


Although the insights we  can have in meditation tell us nothing about  the origins of the universe,
they do confirm some well-established truths about the human mind:

        - our conventional sense of self is an illusion
        - positive emotions,  such as compassion and patience, are teachable  skills
        - the way we think directly influences our experience of the world


Different techniques  of meditation produce  long-lasting changes in attention,  emotion, cognition,
and pain perception, and these correlate with both structural and functional changes in the brain.


The feeling that we call “I” is an illusion.  There is no discrete (distinct) self or ego living
like a Minotaur in the labyrinth of the brain. And  the feeling that there is — the sense of being
perched somewhere behind your eyes, looking out at a world that is separate from yourself — can be
altered  or  entirely  extinguished.  Although  such experiences  of  “self  transcendence“  are
generally thought about in  religious terms, there is nothing, in  principle, irrational about them.
From both a scientific and a philosophical point  of view, they represent a clearer understanding of
the way things are. Deepening that understanding, and repeatedly cutting through the illusion of the
self, is what is meant by “spirituality” in the context of this book.


Any athlete  knows that certain kinds  of pain can be  exquisitely pleasurable. The burn  of lifting
weights, for instance, would  be excruciating if it were a symptom of  terminal illness. But because
it is associated with health and fitness, most  people find it enjoyable. Here we see that cognition
and emotion are not separate. The way we think about experience can completely determine how we feel
about it.


My purpose in  writing this book is  to encourage you to investigate  certain contemplative insights
for yourself, without accepting  the metaphysical ideas that they inspired  in ignorant and isolated
peoples of the past.


Nothing I  say here denies  the fact  that psychological well-being  requires a healthy  ”sense of
self”. Children  need to  become autonomous, confident,  and self-aware in  order to  form healthy
relationships. And  they must acquire  other cognitive, emotional,  and interpersonal skills  in the
process of becoming sane and productive adults. Which is to say that there is a time and a place for
everything.


## Buddhism vs monotheism

The notion of a  “highest common factor” uniting all religions begins to  break apart the moment
one presses  for details. For  instance, the Abrahamic religions  are DUALISTIC and  FAITH-BASED: In
Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the human soul  is conceived as genuinely separate from the divine
reality of God.  The appropriate attitude for a  creature that finds itself in  this circumstance is
some combination  of terror,  shame, and  awe. In  the best case,  notions of  God's love  and grace
provide some relief,  but the central message of these  faiths is that each of us  is separate from,
and in relationship to,  a divine authority who will punish anyone who  harbours the slightest doubt
about His supremacy.

The Eastern tradition  presents a very different  picture of reality. And its  highest teachings —
found within the  various schools of Buddhism  and the nominally Hindu tradition  of Advaita Vedanta
— explicitly  transcend dualism. By  their lights, consciousness itself  is identical to  the very
reality that one might otherwise mistake for God.

The teachings of Buddhism  and Advaita contain empirical insights about  the nature of consciousness
that do not depend upon faith. One can practice most techniques of Buddhist meditation or the method
of self-inquiry of Advaita and experience the  advertised changes in ones consciousness without ever
believing in the law of  karma or in the miracles attributed to Indian mystics.  To get started as a
Christian, however, one must first accept a dozen implausible things about the life of Jesus and the
origins of the  Bible — and the same can  be said, minus a few unimportant  details, about Judaism
and Islam.  If one  should happen  to discover  that the  sense of  being an  individual soul  is an
illusion, one will be guilty of blasphemy everywhere west of the Indus.

One can speak  about Buddhism shorn of its  miracles and irrational assumptions. The  same cannot be
said of Christianity or Islam.


Most of  the scientific  research now done  on meditation focuses  primarily on  Buddhist techniques
because  it  isn’t primarily  a  faith-based  religion, and  its  central  teachings are  entirely
empirical. Despite the superstitions  that many Buddhists cherish, the doctrine  has a practical and
logical core that does not require any unwarranted assumptions.

Buddhism in particular possesses a literature on the nature  of the mind that has no peer in Western
religion or Western science.

Unlike  the doctrines  of  Judaism, Christianity,  and  Islam,  the teachings  of  Buddhism are  not
considered  by their  adherents  to be  the  product  of infallible  revelation.  They are,  rather,
empirical instructions: If you do X, you will experience Y.

I  am not  saying  that most  Buddhists  or  Hindus have  been  sophisticated contemplatives.  Their
traditions have spawned many of the same pathologies we see elsewhere among the faithful: dogmatism,
anti-intellectualism,  tribalism, otherworldliness.  However, the  empirical difference  between the
central teachings of Buddhism and Advaita and those of Western monotheism is difficult to overstate.

One can traverse the Eastern paths simply by becoming  interested in the nature of ones own mind —
especially in the immediate causes of psychological  suffering — and by paying closer attention to
ones experience in every present moment. There is, in truth, nothing one need believe. The teachings
of Buddhism and Advaita  are best viewed as lab manuals and explorers’  logs detailing the results
of empirical research on the nature of human consciousness.
