# How to include the deck `bar` inside the deck `foo`?

Rename it like so:

    foo::bar

You can also drag and drop `bar` inside `foo` from the deck list.
But in general, the drag and drop is less accurate.

This feature allows you to organize decks into a tree.

##
# Which cards will be shown, if I select the deck
## `foo::bar`?

The cards in the subdeck `bar` of the parent deck `foo`.

## `foo`?

The cards in the parent deck `foo`.

##
# Where does anki put a card which somehow becomes separated from all decks?

In the default deck.

##
# Issues
## I can't see the default deck!

That's because it doesn't contain any card, and you have created other decks.
