## ANSI

American National Standards Institute

It's  a  private  non-profit  organization  that  oversees  the  development  of
voluntary consensus  standards for  products, services, processes,  systems, and
personnel in the United States.
The organization also coordinates U.S. standards with international standards so
that American products can be used worldwide.

These standards ensure that the  characteristics and performance of products are
consistent, that  people use the same  definitions and terms, and  that products
are tested the same way.

## ANSI C, ANSI/ISO C, ISO C

Can mean C89 or C99.

##
# b
## bounds-checker

C doesn't require  that array subscripts be checked; a  bounds-checker adds this
capability.

##
# c
## C89

Version of the  C language described in the standard  ANSI X3.159-1989, in 1989,
and ISO/IEC 9899:1990, in 1990.

## C99

Version of the C language described in the standard ISO/IEC 9899:1999, in 1999.

## C11

Version of the C language described in the standard ISO/IEC 9899:2011, in 2011.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_%28C_standard_revision%29>
<https://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/C11Status>

## C17

Version of the C language described in the standard ISO/IEC 9899:2018, in 2018.

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C18_(C_standard_revision)>

The  wikipedia page  uses the  term `C18`,  but on  the web,  and on  the latest
manpage for GCC, `C17` is used more often.

## GNU C

Version of the C language used by GCC by default.

GNU C provides several language features not found in ISO standard C.

##
# d
## directive

Statement beginning with `#`, which will be obeyed by the preprocessor.

##
# h
## header

It contains information about some part of the standard library.

##
# i
## ISO

International Organization for Standardization

It's an international standard-setting  organization composed of representatives
from various national standards organizations.

It promotes worldwide proprietary, industrial and commercial standards.

##
# k
## K&R C

Original version  of C  standardized by  the book  “The C  Programming Language”
written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie.

##
# l
## leak-finder

A leak-finder helps locate memory leaks.

## linker

The linker combines the  object code with any additional code  needed to yield a
complete executable program.
This additional code includes library functions (like `printf`) that are used in
the program.

##
# m
## memory leak

Blocks of memory that are dynamically allocated but never deallocated.

##
# o
## object code

Machine instructions obtained after the compiler has translated your source code file.

##
# p
## preprocessor

The preprocessor obeys the directives found in a source code file.
It's  a bit  like an  editor; it  can add  things to  the source  code and  make
modifications.
