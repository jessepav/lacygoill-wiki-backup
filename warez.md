    $ youtube-dl -g 'webpage url'
                  │
                  └ --get-url

#### How to stream it in mpv?

With a recent enough `mpv(1)`, you can pass it the url directly:

    $ mpv 'url'

This is possible thanks to the youtube-dl hook-script.
The latter looks at  the input URL, and plays the video  located on the website.
It works with many streaming sites, not just youtube.

The youtube-dl hook-script is enabled by  default; `--ytdl` is assumed even when
omitted.

###

## How to change the template used to name a downloaded file?

Use the `-o` argument.

Example:

    -o "%(autonumber)02d - %(title)s.%(ext)s"

This example could name a file like so:

    42 - My Wonderful Video.mp4
    │    │                  │
    │    │                  └ %(ext)s
    │    └ %(title)s
    └ %(autonumber)02d

The item `%(autonumber)0Nd` lets you number the downloaded files, when there are
several (e.g. playlist); 2 specifies the number of digits to use.

If you think you're going to download between 10 and 99 videos, use 2.
Between 100 and 999 videos, use 3.
Etc.
