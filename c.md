            Welcome! This is an instruction booklet that shows you how to build a text editor in C.

            The text editor is antirez’s kilo, with some  changes. It’s about 1000 lines of C in
            a single file with no dependencies, and  it implements all the basic features you expect
            in a minimal editor, as well as syntax highlighting and a search feature.

            This booklet  walks you through  building the editor in  184 steps. Each  step, you’ll
            add, change, or remove a few lines of  code. Most steps, you’ll be able to observe the
            changes you made by compiling and running the program immediately afterwards.

            I explain each  step along the way, sometimes in  a lot of detail. Feel free  to skim or
            skip the prose, as the  main point of this is that you are going  to build a text editor
            from scratch! Anything you  learn along the way is bonus, and  there’s plenty to learn
            just from typing in the changes to the code and observing the results.

            See the appendices for more information on  the tutorial itself (including what to do if
            you get stuck, and where to get help).

            If you’re ready to begin, then go to chapter 1!
