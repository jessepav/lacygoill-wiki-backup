# Read these books:

There aren't many good books.

Most of them seem superficial: they teach you how to use a bunch of tools, which
will probably become obsolete in a few years (if they aren't already).

The few good books I  found are also a bit old, so not sure  how easy it will be
to follow along the exercises.
