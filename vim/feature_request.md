# Issues
## can't customize `C-k` when a dictionary completion is active

If you have a mapping on `C-k`, you've just pressed `C-x C-k`, and you press `C-k`,
Vim will scroll in the wildmenu; it will not invoke your custom mapping.

---

Same issue for other completions: `C-x C-t`, `C-x C-d`, `C-x C-l`, ...

## can't set `'foldopen'` and `'foldclose'` locally to a buffer

It would be useful to toggle an auto-open-fold mode in an arbitrary buffer.

---

Right now,  we do it by  installing temporary mappings (`j`,  `k`, `C-d`, `C-u`,
`gg`, `G`), which automatically open folds.
