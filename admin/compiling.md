# checkinstall
## How can I install the latest version of the script?

    $ git clone http://checkinstall.izto.org/checkinstall.git

    # from the INSTALL file
    $ make
    $ su
    $ make install
    $ checkinstall

##
## Which `$ make` command does checkinstall run by default?

    $ make install

### How to pass it an arbitrary `$ make` command?

Just write it right afterwards:

    $ sudo checkinstall make foo

Equivalent of `$  make install foo`, except  that a deb package  is produced and
installed via `$ dpkg -i foo`.

##
## The installation fails!  “trying to overwrite '...', which is also in package”

If you  know that  the file  which the package  was trying  to overwrite  is not
important, you can manually install the .deb generated by checkinstall:

    $ sudo dpkg -i --force-overwrite package.deb

Otherwise, you'll  have to uninstall  the conflicting package which  has already
installed the problematic file.

Alternatively, if  the path  of the  file ends  with `info/dir`,  try to  find a
configuration option allowing  you to change the location of  the file; it could
be `--infodir`.

Example:

    $ ./configure --infodir=/usr/local/share
                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                    move the info file from `/usr/share/info` to `/usr/local/share/info`

##
# How to find the configuration options which were used to compile a deb package?

In `/etc/apt/sources.list` or in a file in `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/`, uncomment
the `deb-src` line from which the source code of the package can be downloaded.

Then:

    $ sudo aptitude update
    $ mkdir /tmp/dir; cd /tmp/dir
    $ apt-get source <package_name>

If  `$  apt-cache policy`  reports  several  versions,  you  can target  one  in
particular with:

    $ apt-get source <package_name>=<version>

Example:

    $ apt-get source rxvt-unicode-256color

This will download the source code in a directory, as well as a few other files:

    rxvt-unicode-9.22/~
    rxvt-unicode_9.22-1ubuntu1~ppa1~x.debian.tar.xz~
    rxvt-unicode_9.22-1ubuntu1~ppa1~x.dsc~
    rxvt-unicode_9.22.orig.tar.bz2~

Finally, read the file `debian/rules`:

    $ vim rxvt-unicode-9.22/debian/rules

And find the right recipe (e.g. `conf-unicode-256color`):

    conf-unicode-256color:
            $(flagscommon) ./configure $(cfgcommon) \
                --enable-unicode3 \
                --enable-combining \
                --enable-xft \
                --enable-font-styles \
                --enable-256-color \
                --enable-pixbuf \
                --enable-transparency \
                --enable-fading \
                --enable-rxvt-scroll \
                --enable-next-scroll \
                --enable-xterm-scroll \
                --enable-perl \
                --enable-xim \
                --enable-iso14755 \
                --enable-mousewheel \
                --enable-slipwheeling \
                --enable-smart-resize \
                --enable-startup-notification \
                --with-term=rxvt-unicode-256color

Alternatively, you can try to read the buildlog on the web.

For example, for `zsh`, you would first visit:
<https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/zsh>

Then, you would click on the button below “Latest upload”:
<https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/zsh/5.5.1-1ubuntu3>

Then, on the button “amd64” in the section “Builds”:
<https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/zsh/5.5.1-1ubuntu3/+build/16608683>

Finally, on the button “buildlog”:
<https://launchpadlibrarian.net/418666830/buildlog_ubuntu-disco-amd64.zsh_5.5.1-1ubuntu3_BUILDING.txt.gz>

# I found a PPA.  Why do the names of its packages on the web differ from the packages I install on my system?

The package names you see on a page like this:
<https://launchpad.net/~pi-rho/+archive/ubuntu/dev>
... are for *source* packages.
You can  compile a  source code  with various  configuration options  to produce
different binaries.

For example, from the Vim source code, you can compile `vim-gtk` or `vim-tiny`.

    $ apt-get source vim
    $ vim -es vim-*/debian/control +'g/^Package/p' +'qa!'
    Package: vim-common~
    Package: vim-gui-common~
    Package: vim-runtime~
    Package: vim-doc~
    Package: vim-tiny~
    Package: vim~
    Package: vim-gtk~
    Package: vim-gtk3~
    Package: vim-nox~
    Package: vim-athena~
    Package: vim-gnome~
    Package: vim-gtk-py2~
    Package: vim-gtk3-py2~
    Package: vim-nox-py2~
    Package: vim-athena-py2~
    Package: vim-gnome-py2~

# Todo

Document these utilities:
<https://wiki.debian.org/apt-src>
<https://help.ubuntu.com/community/AutoApt>
<https://wiki.ubuntu.com/AutoDeb>

auto-apt can find missing dependencies:

    $ auto-apt search Xlib.h
    usr/include/X11/Xlib.h  libdevel/libx11-dev~

But you need to update its database.

    $ sudo auto-apt update
    $ sudo auto-apt updatedb && sudo auto-apt update-local

And that takes a long time (≈ 25 min).
I don't know how often you have to update.
If you interrupt  an update with `C-c`, the utility  seems broken afterwards; it
doesn't find anything anymore, and you have to restart a complete update.

autodeb is an  experimental script that should perform the  job of both auto-apt
and checkinstall at the same time.
