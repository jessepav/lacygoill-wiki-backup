# MIME
## What's a mimetype?

MIME stands for Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions.

A MIME type is a label used to identify a type of data.
Programs use it to determine how to handle the data they receive.

## What's `xdg-mime`?

A command-line  tool to query  information about  mimetype handling, and  to add
descriptions for new mimetypes.

## When should I change the mimetype of a file?

When double-clicking  on a file,  or using `$  xdg-open`, doesn't open  the file
with the desired program.

## How to get the mimetype of a file?

    $ xdg-mime query filetype <file>

    $ xdg-mime query filetype ~/.vim/vimrc

###
## How to get the default application which handles a particular type of data?

    $ xdg-mime query default <mimetype>

    $ xdg-mime query default text/plain

### How to set it?

    $ xdg-mime default <app.desktop> mimetype ...

    $ xdg-mime default gvim.desktop text/plain text/x-c application/x-shellscript

#### Which pitfall must I avoid before setting it?

Make sure that `<app>.desktop` exists:

    $ locate -i <app>.desktop

If it doesn't, use a regex to widen the search:

    $ locate -r '.*vim\.desktop'
                 ^^
                 any prefix

#### In which file is this setting saved?

    ~/.config/mimeapps.list

There may be other files (like `~/.local/share/applications/mimeapps.list`), use
`$ locate` to find them:

    $ locate -i mimeapps.list

## How to set firefox as the default web browser?

    $Â xdg-settings set default-web-browser firefox.desktop

## How to set gVim as the default handler for all known text files?

    $ find /usr/share/mime/text -iname '*.xml' -execdir basename -s .xml -- '{}' ';' \
        | xargs xdg-mime default gvim.desktop

### How to configure the handler to pass arbitrary options to the gVim command?

You can use your own `gvim.desktop` in your home:

    $ cp /usr/local/share/applications/gvim.desktop ~/.local/share/applications/gvim.desktop

If you do so, it has the priority over the system one.

Edit the `Exec` directive to pass the desired options.
