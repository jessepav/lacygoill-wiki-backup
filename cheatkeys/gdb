add breakpoint on main function    break *main

add breakpoint on given address    break *0x<address>
# only works as expected if executed after run (not before)
# Alternative:{{{

#     break *main+123
#                ^--^
# byte offset from start of main function, which you can find
# in output of `disassemble main`
