## OpenSSH

It's the  most widely deployed  implementation of the  SSH protocol, and  is the
standard  SSH implementation  in  the Linux  and  BSD world.   It  comes in  two
versions, OpenBSD and Portable OpenSSH.

The OpenBSD version is small and secure, but only supports OpenBSD.

The  OpenSSH Portability  Team  takes  the OpenBSD  version  and  adds the  glue
necessary to  make OpenSSH  work on other  operating systems,  creating Portable
OpenSSH.   Indeed,   different  operating   systems  use   different  compilers,
libraries, authentication systems, ...

## SSH

SSH stands for "Secure SHell".

It's a  protocol for  creating an encrypted  communications channel  between two
networked hosts.  SSH  protects data passing between two machines  so that other
people cannot eavesdrop on it.

It was designed  to replace insecure protocols such as  telnet, RSH, and rlogin.
Many software packages rely on it for encrypted and well-authenticated transport
of data across private, public, and hostile networks.
