# c
## CapWords

Synonym for CamelCase.  Used by PEP8 when recommending to name a class using the
CapWords notation.

##
# i
## immutable

Said of something which cannot change.

##
# l
## logical error

Error in the logic of the code.

This is different than a syntax error or a type error.
A syntax or type error causes Python to raise an exception; not a logical error.
A logical error can only be handled by writing a proper test.

## logical expression

Expression which can be tested by an `if` statement or a conditional operator.
It's built from relational, equality, and logical operators.
It always evaluates to a Boolean value, `True` or `False`.

## PEP

Python Enhancement Proposal

## PEP 8

This PEP  specifies some coding conventions  with regards to how  Python code in
the standard library should be formatted/styled.

When working on a particular project, you should respect its style.
When  working on  your own  project, you  can do  whatever you  want, but  being
consistent helps, hence why you should follow *some* conventions.

In the absence of a particular style guide, PEP 8 is a good starting point.
You can follow it, or use it to build your own.

See: <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/>

##
# t
## tuple

Immutable list.

It's useful when  you want to store a  set of values that should  not be changed
throughout the life of a program.
