Long configuration files are painful to read/edit.
We have to fold them in small sections to make them more digestible.

Folding them is often tedious. Especially we come back editing an old file where
we've piled up a lot of text, which has never been folded.

It would be nice to develop a strategy and tools to fold files more quickly.

Which logic should we follow to determine the sections?
Which kind of title should we give to the folds?
